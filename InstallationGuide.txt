# Installation Guide for Translation Quality Checker Project

## Prerequisites
1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from [VSCode Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed on your system. Download from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).

## Steps to Set Up
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project folder in VSCode.
3. Install a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     source ./venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Open the terminal in VSCode and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Python script (`main.py`) to launch the Gradio interface:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Outputs
- The Gradio interface will open in a web browser.
- You can input the source text, human translation, source language, target language, and task type.
- Outputs include:
  - Generated Translation (`A_prime`).
  - Back Translation (`B_prime`).
  - Individual metric scores (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, etc.).
  - Aggregate score (overall quality assessment).
